# Why High Neurodivergence in Sound/Music Computing Students is Expected

## The "Expected Bias" Explained

### General Population Prevalence:
- **ASD (Autism)**: 2.8% (1 in 36)
- **ADHD**: 9.4% in children, 4.4% in adults
- **Combined neurodivergent**: ~12-15%
- **Neurotypical**: ~85%

### Your Sample (Sound/Music Computing Students):
- **Neurodivergent patterns**: 72.3% (13/18)
- **Neurotypical patterns**: 27.8% (5/18)

### This is 5-7× higher than expected. Why?

## 1. **Domain Attraction Hypothesis**

Neurodivergent individuals are disproportionately drawn to technical/auditory fields:

### Autism Spectrum:
- **Heightened auditory sensitivity** → intense interest in sound manipulation
- **Pattern recognition strengths** → attracts to signal processing, audio engineering
- **Systematic thinking** → enjoys technical/mathematical aspects of sound
- **Detail orientation** → appreciates subtle audio nuances others miss
- **Special interests** → music/sound often becomes hyperfocus area

**Literature Support**:
- Baron-Cohen et al. (2001): Higher autism traits in STEM fields
- Ruzich et al. (2015): Technical disciplines show elevated autistic traits
- Wei et al. (2015): Musicians show higher sensory sensitivity scores

### ADHD:
- **Sensation seeking** → drawn to rich, stimulating audio environments
- **Creativity** → music/sound as expressive outlet
- **Hyperfocus capability** → can intensely engage with audio production
- **Novelty seeking** → constantly exploring new sounds, effects

**Literature Support**:
- Panagiotidi et al. (2018): ADHD associated with auditory processing differences
- White & Shah (2011): ADHD linked to creative achievements

## 2. **Self-Selection in Graduate Programs**

Sound and Music Computing is a niche field requiring:
- Strong mathematical/technical skills
- Interest in auditory perception
- Willingness to work with complex systems
- Often solitary work (programming, studio time)

**These characteristics align with:**
- Autistic cognitive profile (systemizing, pattern recognition)
- ADHD hyperfocus capabilities
- General neurodivergent strengths

People who struggle with these traits wouldn't pursue the field.

## 3. **Sensory Sensitivity → Career Choice**

**Hypersensitive individuals** (50% of your sample):
- Notice subtle audio differences others miss
- May have found "their thing" in audio work where sensitivity is an asset
- Understand sound at a granular level because they FEEL it more intensely

**Hyposensitive/Seeking individuals**:
- Crave rich audio stimulation → create it professionally
- Need high levels of sound engagement → career in audio satisfies this

Sound/Music Computing turns sensory "differences" into professional advantages.

## 4. **Convenience Sampling Bias**

Your sample = graduate students in one specific program

**Not representative of**:
- General population
- All music professionals
- People with diagnosed vs undiagnosed conditions
- Different age groups, cultures, or education levels

**Example parallel**: If you sampled computer science students for autism traits, you'd find higher rates than the general population. This doesn't mean CS *causes* autism - it means autistic individuals are more likely to choose CS.

## 5. **VR Research Volunteer Bias**

People who volunteer for VR sensory research may:
- Have particular interest in sensory experiences
- Be more aware of their sensory processing
- Enjoy novel technological experiences (sensation seeking)
- Feel comfortable with immersive technology

This further skews toward neurodivergent profiles.

## What This Means for Your Paper

### Frame It As:
> "The high prevalence of hypersensitive profiles (50%) and overall neurodivergent patterns (72.3%) in our sample reflects expected self-selection bias in a Sound and Music Computing graduate program. Individuals with heightened auditory sensitivity or sensation-seeking traits may be disproportionately attracted to audio-focused technical fields, where their sensory processing characteristics become professional assets rather than challenges. This prevalence is 5-7× higher than general population rates (ASD: 2.8%, ADHD: 9.4%), consistent with domain-specific recruitment patterns observed in other technical fields (Baron-Cohen et al., 2001; Ruzich et al., 2015)."

### This is IMPORTANT to note because:

1. **Your results are valid** for your sample
2. **But cannot be generalized** to claim "50% of people are hypersensitive"
3. **The patterns are real** - these students genuinely show these traits
4. **The prevalence is sample-specific** - different population would show different rates

## Analogy

It's like finding that 80% of basketball players are over 6 feet tall.

- This doesn't mean 80% of *people* are over 6 feet
- Tall people are more likely to pursue basketball
- The finding is real but sample-specific
- You're measuring true height, but in a biased sample

Similarly:
- Your behavioral measurements are accurate
- But you're measuring a self-selected group
- Sound/music computing attracts certain sensory profiles
- General population would show very different distribution

---

## Bottom Line

The "bias" isn't an error - it's an expected consequence of studying a specialized population. Sound/Music Computing students likely have higher rates of auditory sensitivity and neurodivergent traits because **those traits led them to choose that field in the first place**. Your results are valid for understanding sensory profiles in this population, but prevalence estimates cannot be extended to the general public without stratified sampling.
