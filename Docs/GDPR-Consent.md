# 🛡️ GDPR Consent and Data Use Statement

## Purpose of Data Collection

Neuroverse collects minimal data to enable sensory adaptation for enhanced user comfort, accessibility, and inclusion within the VR/AR experience.

This data may include:
- Eye tracking metrics (e.g., gaze duration, blink rate)
- Head movement data (e.g., motion smoothness)
- Interaction patterns (e.g., button press timing)
- Haptic feedback preferences (e.g., vibration comfort levels)
- Self-reported questionnaire data (e.g., sensory preferences, cultural/gender identity)

## Type of Data Collected

| Data Type                  | Purpose                                     | Stored? | Anonymized? |
|---------------------------|---------------------------------------------|---------|-------------|
| Eye movement metrics      | Visual sensory calibration                  | Yes     | ✅          |
| Head motion patterns      | Motion filtering and comfort                | Yes     | ✅          |
| Audio interaction logs    | Response timing and auditory feedback       | No      | ❌          |
| Questionnaire answers     | Preference profile generation               | Yes     | ✅          |
| Haptic feedback responses | Comfort calibration during interaction      | Yes     | ✅          |

All data is anonymized at the point of collection and never linked to personal identity.

## Your Rights

Under the GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation), you have the right to:
- 🧾 Access any data we collect about you
- 🧹 Request its deletion
- 🛑 Withdraw consent at any time
- 🎛️ Opt out of specific sensory modalities (see below)

## Sensory Modality Preferences

You have the right to opt out of specific adaptive experiences based on personal comfort or sensory processing needs. These can be disabled manually before or during the session:

- 🖼️ **Visual Adaptation** (e.g., brightness/contrast changes) → ✅ Optional
- 🔊 **Auditory Filtering** (e.g., noise dampening or enhancements) → ✅ Optional
- 🎮 **Motion Smoothing** (e.g., camera/scene transitions) → ✅ Optional
- ✋ **Haptic Feedback** (e.g., controller vibrations) → ✅ Optional

If you choose to opt out of one or more sensory modalities, the system will default to baseline settings for those areas without affecting your ability to participate.

## Consent

By proceeding in the Neuroverse experience, you acknowledge that:
- You have read and understood this GDPR consent form
- You agree to anonymous data collection for sensory adaptation
- You may withdraw at any point without penalty
- You may opt out of any sensory modality (visual, auditory, motion, haptic) at any time

✅ If you agree to the above, you may continue into the calibration scene.
