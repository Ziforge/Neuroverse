# 🕒 Neuroverse Weekly Timesheet Instructions

This page explains how to use the automated weekly timesheet system for tracking your project contributions in the **Neuroverse** repo.

## ✅ What Is It?

Every Monday, a script automatically generates a timesheet file for the current week:

📂 `weekly_notes/week-<XX>-timesheet.md`

Each file includes a table for every group member to log:
- 📋 The task(s) they worked on
- 📊 Estimated hours
- ⏱️ Actual time logged

---

## 🧭 How to Fill Out Your Timesheet

1. **Open the file for the current week** (e.g., `week-12-timesheet.md`)
2. Find your row in the table
3. Fill in the following:
   - Your current task
   - Estimated time
   - Time actually spent
